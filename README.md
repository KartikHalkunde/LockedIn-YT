### The Problem: The YouTube Rabbit Hole 

You open YouTube with a noble goal: to learn a new skill, watch a documentary, or catch up on an educational series.

An hour later, you snap out of a trance. You've been scrolling through an endless feed of Shorts, algorithm-pushed recommendations, and viral **"brain rot"** that has nothing to do with why you came here. The rabbit hole is deep, and YouTube's engaging algorithm is masterfully designed to keep you there, consuming content instead of learning.

### The Solution: LockedIn 

**LockedIn is your escape hatch.** It's a powerful browser extension that puts *you* back in the driver's seat. It allows you to surgically remove every single distraction from the YouTube interface, transforming it into the incredible learning library it's meant to be.

With a sleek, modern, and intuitive popup menu, you can finally use YouTube on your own terms.

LockedIn is just getting started. Here's a preview of what's planned for future updates:

* **Total Shorts Annihilation:** An even more powerful filter to eliminate Shorts from *everywhere* (including history and playlists) without a trace.
* **Focus Modes:** Introducing **"LockedIn Moderate"** (for casual focus) and **"LockedIn Hard"** (for deep work), which will automatically set the best combination of toggles.
* **Light Mode Theme:** A new, clean light-mode theme for the popup, with a toggle to switch between light and dark.
* **And more:** Bug fixes, performance improvements, and other features based on user feedback.

## Availability

* **Firefox Add-ons:** Coming soon! The extension is being prepared for review.
* **Chrome Web Store:** Planned for a future release.

This project was heavily inspired by the fantastic work on the [Unhook]([https://github.com/hook-flow/unhook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)) extension. LockedIn aims to provide a similar level of powerful control with a unique and modern user interface.
