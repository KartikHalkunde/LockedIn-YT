### Step 4: Source Code (Optional)
If Mozilla requests source code:

2. Upload `lockedin-source-1.0.6.zip`
3. Add build instructions:

```
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

This extension uses NO build tools, bundlers, or transpilers.
It's pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

To verify the source code matches the submitted extension:

1. Extract the source archive:
   unzip lockedin-source-1.0.6.zip
   cd LockedIn-YT/

2. Run the build script:
   bash build.sh
   
   This creates lockedin-1.0.6.zip (identical to submitted file)

3. The build script simply packages these files:
   - manifest.json
   - content.js
   - icons/ (3 PNG files)
   - popup/ (3 files: HTML, CSS, JS)
   - homepage/ (5 compressed JPEG memes)

No transformation, compilation, or minification occurs.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Bash shell (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows)
- Python 3.6+ (used if zip command not available)

The extension is deterministic - same source always produces identical output.
```
