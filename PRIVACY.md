# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

**LockedIn collects ZERO data.**

Everything happens locally in your browser. The extension:

- ❌ Does NOT make any network requests
- ❌ Does NOT collect any personal data
- ❌ Does NOT use analytics or telemetry
- ❌ Does NOT track your browsing history
- ❌ Does NOT communicate with external servers

## Data Storage

Your settings are stored locally using your browser's storage API:

- **What is stored**: Your toggle preferences (hide feed, hide shorts, etc.)
- **Where it's stored**: Your browser's local storage
- **Who can access it**: Only you
- **Sync**: If you use browser sync, settings sync across your devices through your browser's built-in sync (Firefox Sync, Edge Sync, etc.)

## Permissions

LockedIn only requests the permissions it actually needs:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `storage` | Saves your preferences so they persist across browser sessions |
| `*://www.youtube.com/*` | Allows the extension to modify YouTube pages |

That's it. No tracking, no data collection, no network requests to external servers.

## How It Works

1. You toggle a setting in the popup
2. The setting is saved to browser storage
3. The extension applies the setting to YouTube pages
4. Everything stays on your device

## Open Source
